# TranslationApp

A translation portal that helps effectively translate from one language to other.

This project aims at developing a language translation portal that helps effectively translate from one language to other with manner of speech and local region in consideration. The normal translations are fetched via APIs further appropriate localized translations with manner of speech in consideration are validated and upvoted via community. Technologies to be used Flutter, AWS APIs, Empath API etc.  

### Background of this project:

Language provides a means for communication, a vehicle for expressing thoughts and feelings. Having a common language for talking about and across difference is essential for breaking down divisions and achieving understanding and partnership. Hence, there is a constant requirement of a tool or an application to do so. There are several translating apps as well as services but none of them provide an effective translating solution. The reason why these models have failed because the current translating solutions offer direct word to word translations with some machine learning and ai algo overlays over it but it fails to understand the diverse nature of languages. Languages are of diverse form varying region to region even in case of the same language and is also of evolving form that the changes from time to time. 

Language is best defined by the people who speak them. Hence, an active community involvement might be the best solution. There are several open-source or community-based models that have proven themselves as the finest in their various fields. We have also tried to come up with a community-based solution with which we hope to solve this issue.
